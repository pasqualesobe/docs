# Multiple sheets
```shell
# Get whole spreadsheet from sheet named Sheet2
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/020b2c0f/sheets/Sheet2"
```

```shell
# Adds single row to sheet named "Sheet2"
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/020b2c0f/sheets/Sheet2" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "foo": "6", "another column": "quux" }'
```

```ruby
require 'sheetsu'
sheetsu = Sheetsu::Client.new("020b2c0f")
```

```ruby
# Get whole spreadsheet from sheet named Sheet2
sheetsu.read(sheet: "Sheet2")
```

```ruby
# Adds single row to sheet named "Sheet2"
sheetsu.create({ "foo" => "bar", "another column" => "quux" }, "Sheet2")
```

By default, always the first sheet (aka worksheet aka tab) is accessed. To access other sheets within a spreadsheet add `/sheets/{sheet_name}` path to the URL if using cURL, or pass appropriate param when using a lib.

# Authentication
```shell
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/020b2c0f" \
-u 'your_api_key:your_api_secret'
```

```ruby
# Create new client object with HTTP Basic Auth keys
sheetsu = Sheetsu::Client.new(
  "020b2c0f",
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  api_secret: "YOUR_API_SECRET"
)
```

You can secure your API with HTTP Basic authentication. It can be turned on in the API settings.

You have to send `api_key` and `api_secret` when you have authentication turned on.

# Creating API programmatically

```shell
# Creates new API
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/api_sheets" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "email": "your@email.com", "api_key": "api_key", "google_spreadsheet_url": "your_doc_url" }'
```
