# How to prepare spreadsheet

Every spreadsheet should have the first row populated with column names. There are no mandatory fields or values you _need_ to have in your spreadsheet. The structure of the spreadsheet is totally up to you. Just keep in mind, that the first row (row #1) is treated as there are column names.

Column names can be anything. Strings, numbers, symbols, emojis ðŸ™‰ , anything.

You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WTwXrh2ZDXmXATZlQIuapdv4ldyhJGZg7LX8GlzPdZw/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">check example spreadsheet here</a>. It looks like this:

# About the API

The Sheetsu API is meant to provide a RESTful way to interact with a Google Spreadsheets. Our API uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP Basic authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.

We support cross-origin resource sharing. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.

The requests in the right sidebar are designed to work as is. The sample requests are performed using our test API and test spreadsheet, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WTwXrh2ZDXmXATZlQIuapdv4ldyhJGZg7LX8GlzPdZw/edit#gid=0).
