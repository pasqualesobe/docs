# SDKs & Client libraries
Official libraries for the Sheetsu API are available in Ruby and JavaScript.

* Node: [https://github.com/sheetsu/sheetsu-node](https://github.com/sheetsu/sheetsu-node)
* Ruby: [https://github.com/sheetsu/sheetsu-ruby](https://github.com/sheetsu/sheetsu-ruby)

# How to prepare spreadsheet

Every spreadsheet should have the first row populated with column names. There are no mandatory fields or values you _need_ to have in your spreadsheet. The structure of the spreadsheet it's totally up to you. Just keep in mind, that the first row (row #1) is treated as there are column names.

Column names can be anything. Strings, numbers, symbols, emojis ðŸ™‰ , anything.

You can [check example spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WTwXrh2ZDXmXATZlQIuapdv4ldyhJGZg7LX8GlzPdZw/edit#gid=0). It looks like this:

id | name | score
---|------|------
1 | Peter | 43
2 | Lois | 89
3 | Meg | 10
4 | Chris | 43
5 | Stewie | 72

# Google Spreadsheet URL

To properly use Sheetsu, please paste Google Spreadsheets URL. Just copy the URL from the browser address bar. There's no need for sharing the Google Spreadsheet.

# About the API

The Sheetsu API is meant to provide a RESTful way to interact with a Google Spreadsheets. Our API uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP Basic authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.

We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.

The requests in the right sidebar are designed to work as is. The sample requests are performed using our test API and test spreadsheet, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WTwXrh2ZDXmXATZlQIuapdv4ldyhJGZg7LX8GlzPdZw/edit#gid=0).

-X PUT \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "id": "2", "name": "Loo1z", "score": "99999" }'
```

```shell
# Update all rows from sheet "Sheet2"
# where value of column foo is bar
# Update only baz colum
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/020b2c0f/sheets/Sheet2/foo/bar" \
-X PATCH \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "baz": "quux" }'
```

```ruby
require 'sheetsu'
sheetsu = Sheetsu::Client.new("020b2c0f")
```

```ruby
# Update all rows where value of column name is Peter
# Update only score column
client.update(
  "name",          # column name
  "Peter",         # value to search for
  { score: 1337 }, # hash with updates
)
```

```ruby
# Update all rows where value of column name is Lois
# Update whole row
client.update(
  "name", # column name
  "Lois", # value to search for
   # hash with updates
  { "id": 2, "name" => "Loo1z", "score": 99999 },
  true # nullify all fields not passed in the hash above
)
```

```ruby
# Update all rows from sheet "Sheet2"
# where value of column foo is bar
# Update only baz colum
# Empty all cells which are not 'score' or 'last name'
# (in other words, send PUT)
client.update(
  "foo", # column name
  "bar", # value to search for
  # hash with updates
  { "baz" => "quux" },
  false, # update only passed columns
  "Sheet2"
)
```

Send `PATCH` (or `PUT`) request to update value(s) of a row(s). To identify the row(s) you want to update you need to add `/{column_name}/{value}` to the API URL. Then you need to pass JSON object with new values. Updates only rows where `{column_name}` match `{value}`.

### Difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`
* `PUT` request updates whole row. If you do not provide all fields in the JSON object, some fields might get emptied. `PUT` returns whole updated row(s).
* `PATCH` request updates only values passed in JSON. Returns only updated fields.

### Returns
An array of updated objects. If a request is sent via `PATCH` method returns only updated values. If a request is sent via `PUT` method returns only updated values.

# DELETE
```shell
# Deletes all rows where name is Lois
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/020b2c0f/name/Lois" \
-X DELETE
```

```shell
# Delete all rows from sheet "Sheet2"
# where value of column foo is bar
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/020b2c0f/sheets/Sheet2/foo/bar" \
-X DELETE
```

```ruby
require 'sheetsu'
sheetsu = Sheetsu::Client.new("020b2c0f")
```

```ruby
# Delete all rows where value of column name is Lois
sheetsu.delete(
  "name", # column name
  "Lois", # value to search for
)
```

```ruby
# Delete rows from sheet "Sheet2"
# where value of column foo is bar
sheetsu.delete(
  "foo",   # column name
  "bar",   # value to search for
  "Sheet2" # sheet name
)
```

Send DELETE request with a `/{column_name}/{value}` path added at the end of the URL to delete row(s). Deletes row(s) where `{column_name}` match `{value}`.

### Returns
On success, returns `204 No Content` HTTP status code, without a body.

1. Add `sheetsu="YOUR_API_URL"` to the parent element.
2. Add handlebars ( `{{` and `}}` ) with column name to any child element, with column name.

### Search
You can use an additional `sheetsu-search` attribute to show only results which are matching your search criteria.

The value of the `sheetsu-search` attribute should be a key-value object ([JSON](http://json.org/example.html)) with column name and value you want to use for search.

Remember to use single quote `'` around JSON and double quote `"` with JSON key, value names.

### Limit & offset

Attributes you can use to manipulate results are `sheetsu-limit` and `sheetsu-offset`.

*(We add a little bit of CSS styling to the results on the right)*

# Save data to Spreadsheet
```html
<!--
  This code will display form, which will
  save record to the Google Spreadsheet
  (check it here: )
-->
<form sheetsu="https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/1c3c0ff33">

  <input type="text" name="email">
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>

  <input type="submit">

  </div>
</blockquote>


1. Add `sheetsu` attribute to the `<form>` element.
2. Add `<input>` (or `<textarea>`) tags, where `name` attribute is column name from a spreadsheet.

### After submit redirection
Optionally you can add `sheetsu-after-submit` attribute with the URL you want to redirect your users after they submit the form. Without this attribute, they get redirected to [`https://sheetsu.com/thank-you.html`](https://sheetsu.com/thank-you.html).

# Other

# Multiple sheets
```shell
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/020b2c0f/sheets/Sheet2"
```

```ruby
require 'sheetsu'

sheetsu = Sheetsu::Client.new("020b2c0f")
sheetsu.read(sheet: "Sheet2")
```

By default, always the first sheet (aka worksheet aka tab) is accessed. To access other sheets within a spreadsheet add `/sheets/{sheet_name}` path to the URL if using cURL, or pass appropriate param when using a lib.

# Authentication
```shell
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/020b2c0f" \
-u 'your_api_key:your_api_secret'
```

```ruby
# Create new client object with HTTP Basic Auth keys
sheetsu = Sheetsu::Client.new(
  "020b2c0f",
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  api_secret: "YOUR_API_SECRET"
)
```

You can secure your API with HTTP Basic authentication. It can be turned on in the API settings.

You have to send `api_key` and `api_secret` when you have authentication turned on.

# Rate Limits
Every API has a rate limit. You can check your rate limit for your APIs here. After hitting the limit for the particular API, you receive `429 Rate limit exceeded` status code.

# HTTP Status Codes
Every response from the API is a JSON encoded string with a significant HTTP status code.

Code | Description
-----|------------
`200 OK` | Standard response for successful GET, PUT and PATCH requests
`201 Created` | Successful response for POST requests
`204 No Content` | Successful response for DELETE requests
`400 Bad Request` | Error response when creating (`POST`) or updating (`PUT`, `PATCH`) row(s)
`401 Unauthorized` | Error response when wrong authorization credentials provided
`402 Payment Required` | Returned if pro feature ([multiple sheets](#multiple-sheets)) is tried to be accessed from free account
`403 Forbidden` | Error response when action is forbidden by the user (API owner)
`404 No such route` | Error response when route doesn't exist
`429 Rate limit exceeded` | Error response when API hits quota exceeded
`500 Server error` | 

Each API URL has an `id`, which identifies it. It is part of the URL which is after `https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/`.
